Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks-
This Python script is a simple program I wrote to practice working with dictionaries and user input. The goal was to store student names and their marks, then allow the user to look up marks by entering a student's name.
1. Creates a dictionary with some student names and their marks.
2. Takes input from the user (asks for a student’s name).
3. Checks if the name exists in the dictionary.
4. If found, prints the marks. If not, shows a message saying the student wasn’t found.


Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing-
This small Python script is something I wrote to practice and demonstrate list slicing in Python. The idea was to:
- Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extract the first five numbers using slicing.
- Reverse those five numbers.
- Print both the original slice and the reversed version.
